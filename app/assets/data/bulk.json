Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium heat.  Add garlic, onions and bacon.  Saut until onions are translucent.  Add vinegar, Texas Pete, the stock and beer.  Bring to a boil, and add the remaining ingredients.2. Stir in the collards a few at a time (they will wilt, so you will have enough room to get them all into the pot).  Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until tender.For the oysters:1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  2. In a small bowl, combine the cornbread crumbs with melted butter until evenly coated.  Place the crumbs on an ungreased baking pan and bake for 10 to 15 minutes until lightly toasted, stirring once or twice.  You want them crunchy, but not too brown, since they will brown later in the recipe.  Remove from the pan and set aside.3. Combine the collard greens with the heavy cream.  Add a few dashes of Texas Pete's, to taste.  Add more cream, if necessary, to achieve a nice, creamy consistency.  Refrigerate the mixture until ready to use.4. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees.  5. Take a metal baking pan (large enough for 12 oysters) and place Kosher salt over most of the bottom of the pan.  Use just enough so your oysters can sit upright in the salt (this will ensure that they do not tip over while baking).  6. Take the oysters that have been cleaned and shucked and drain most of the liquid from the oyster.  Place them in the bed of Kosher salt to assemble.7. Put a teaspoon (or a little more, to taste) of the collard and cream mixture on top of each oyster.  Add a little of the chopped bacon.  Follow this with a sprinkling of cornbread crumbs and then finish with a little of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.  Dot the top of each oyster with butter.8. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 12 to 15 minutes.  If the tops have not browned enough, place them under the broiler for just a few seconds until desired brownness is achieved and collard mixture is slightly bubbling.  Serve immediately with a few additional splashes of Texas Pete's hot sauce, if desired.","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"For the collards","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium heat.","ingredients":[],"equipment":[{"id":404752,"name":"pot","image":"stock-pot.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Add garlic, onions and bacon.

Add the onion and cook over moderate heat until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until cooked through, about 3 minutes. Add the apple, garlic, thyme and sage and cook until the apple just begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir in the collard greens and cook until wilted, about 2 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl and let cool to room temperature. Mix in the goat cheese and season the stuffing with salt and pepper.                                              Light a grill. Using a long, thin knife and beginning at a thick end, cut a 1-inch-wide pocket through the center of each pork tenderloin; use the handle of a wooden spoon to widen the pocket if necessary. Fill the pork tenderloins with the stuffing, poking it in with the wooden spoon.

Grill the pork tenderloins over moderately high heat, turning four times, until browned on every side, about 25 minutes, or the internal temperature reaches 140.

Transfer the contents of the saucepan to a blender and puree until smooth. Strain the sauce back into the saucepan and boil until it coats the back of a spoon, about 5 minutes.

Try pairing with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Riesling. Chardonnay suits simple chops or chops in a butter or cream sauce, dry riesling complements sweet additions like honey mustard or apples, and pinot noir is a safe bet for pork dishes in general. The Louis Jadot Chardonnay with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 22 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":435857,"title":"Louis Jadot Chardonnay","description":"Jadot Chardonnay is vinified and blended exclusively from Chardonnay grapes selected from the production of numerous growers in the Côte Chalonnais, the Côte Mâconnais and the Hautes-Côtes de Beaune, with a small proportion of superior village-level wines added in most vintages to improve the finished cuvée. Styled to be fuller in body and structure than most of Jadots Mâconnais wines, it is partially fermented and aged in oak casks to add breadth to the ripe fruit notes. The lovely, elegant Chardonnay nose, offset by a gentle touch of vanilla, carries into excellent balance of medium-full fruit and acidity on the palate and a lingering finish.","price":"$21.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/435857-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.8,"ratingCount":7.0,"score":0.7545454545454546,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Flouis-jadot-chardonnay-2013%2F134128"}]},"instructions":null,"analyzedInstructions":[],"sourceName":null,"creditsText":null},{"vegetarian":false,"vegan":false,"glutenFree":false,"dairyFree":true,"veryHealthy":false,"cheap":false,"veryPopular":false,"sustainable":false,"weightWatcherSmartPoints":16,"gaps":"no","lowFodmap":false,"sourceUrl":"http://www.ifyoucanmakethatyoucanmakethis.com/archives/395","spoonacularSourceUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/tarte-tatin-67748","aggregateLikes":23,"spoonacularScore":33.0,"healthScore":2.0,"creditsText":"If You Can Make That You Can Make This","sourceName":"If You Can Make That You Can Make This","pricePerServing":161.74,"extendedIngredients":[{"id":10862,"aisle":"Meat","image":"cooked-bacon.jpg","consitency":"solid","name":"pan-fried bacon","original":"Oven proof pan (I have a cast iron skillet, though before I was given that as a wedding present, I used a ceramic pie dish and sautéed the apples in a frying pan first)","originalString":"Oven proof pan (I have a cast iron skillet, though before I was given that as a wedding present, I used a ceramic pie dish and sautéed the apples in a frying pan first)","originalName":"Oven proof pan (I have a cast iron skillet, though before I was given that as a wedding present, I used a ceramic pie dish and sautéed the apples in a frying pan first)","amount":6.0,"unit":"servings","meta":["(I have a cast iron skillet, though before I was given that as a wedding present, I used a ceramic pie dish and sautéed the apples in a frying pan first)"],"metaInformation":["(I have a cast iron skillet, though before I was given that as a wedding present, I used a ceramic pie dish and sautéed the apples in a frying pan first)"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":6.0,"unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings"},"metric":{"amount":6.0,"unitShort":"servings","unitLong":"servings"}}},{"id":18337,"aisle":"Refrigerated;Frozen","image":"puff-pastry.png","consitency":"solid","name":"puff pastry","original":"1 block of frozen puff pastry","originalString":"1 block of frozen puff pastry","originalName":"block of frozen puff pastry","amount":1.0,"unit":"","meta":["frozen"],"metaInformation":["frozen"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}},{"id":19335,"aisle":"Baking","image":"sugar-in-bowl.png","consitency":"solid","name":"sugar","original":"1 cup (7 oz ish) of sugar","originalString":"1 cup (7 oz ish) of sugar","originalName":"(7 oz ish) of sugar","amount":1.0,"unit":"cup","meta":["(7 oz ish)"],"metaInformation":["(7 oz ish)"],"measures":{"us":{"amount":1.0,"unitShort":"cup","unitLong":"cup"},"metric":{"amount":236.588,"unitShort":"ml","unitLong":"milliliters"}}},{"id":1029003,"aisle":"Produce","image":"grannysmith-apple.png","consitency":"solid","name":"tart apples","original":"8 tart eating apples","originalString":"8 tart eating apples","originalName":"tart eating apples","amount":8.0,"unit":"","meta":[],"metaInformation":[],"measures":{"us":{"amount":8.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""},"metric":{"amount":8.0,"unitShort":"","unitLong":""}}}],"id":67748,"title":"Tarte Tatin","readyInMinutes":45,"servings":6,"image":"https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/67748-556x370.jpg","imageType":"jpg","summary":"Watching your figure?
