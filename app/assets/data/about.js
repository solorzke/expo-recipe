It's a way to help reveal all the different kinds of combinations of dishes you can make using the ingredients you already have at home. With Recipe Search, we're interested in helping to bring new tasty experiences to the user.`

I made this app in my spare time to figure out how I can make recipes with the spare amount of ingredients I had lying around with a tight budget. As the app continued to grow, I reconformed the app so it would rather work for any type of user facing the same problem, instead of my own. `
